Library to convert real life activities into characters stats for an RPG.

The purpose of this library is to provide a means to start gamifiying life (and life goals) by coming up with conversions between activities (like running, chess, knitting) and stat points (Strength, Dexterity, Focus, Vitality).

We can't think of everything, so comments and community contributions are more than welcome!
